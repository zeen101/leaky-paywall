== Description ==

[Leaky Paywall](https://leakypaywall.com/) is a subscription management platform built natively for WordPress. It lets publishers and developers implement a highly customizable subscription system for news, magazine, and content creators.

Our open-source solution offers a suite of tools to nurture reader engagement, streamline subscription processes, and maximize revenue opportunities, all while ensuring compliance with SCA and GDPR regulations.

Leaky Paywall flexibility presents an opportunity to tailor the subscription experience to fit the unique needs of each publisher.

* Customizable paywall settings (metered, dynamic, hybrid, hard, time-wall)
* Customize access using our hooks and filters
* Content indexed by search engines and socially shareable via metering or referrer source
* Subscriber only newsletter capabilities

For developers looking to extend the platform's capabilities, the add-on system provides a flexible way to meet the diverse needs of publishers.

The platform is backed by extensive [documentation](https://docs.leakypaywall.com/), Zoom level support and a community of contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeen101/leaky-paywall), encouraging ongoing development and innovation.

This core plugin lets you set up 1 non-recurring subscription level with Stripe or PayPal integration. It also supports all of our [extensions](https://leakypaywall.com/downloads/category/leaky-paywall-addons/).

The Leaky Paywall meter restricts by X number of free articles over a Y time period. days, weeks, months, years. There is a visibility setting on the post edit screen you can use to override the global meter setting. EG: make an article always free or always require a subscription

You can sell daily, weekly, monthly, and annual subscriptions, both one time and recurring. You can also offer a free subscription in exchange for an email address.
